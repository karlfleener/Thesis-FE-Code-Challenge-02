### Suggested Updates to UI

#### 1. Text Styling Inconsistent
- header navigation is capitalized
- footer navigation is all uppercase
- keep styling for both navigation consistent

#### 2. Fonts Inconsistent
- multiple fonts are used across the UI
- if we want to have multiple fonts we could do the something like the following...
  - all headers should be 1 consistent font
  - all paragraph bodies should be 1 consistent font
- else keep font consistent across UI

#### 3. Letter Spacing Inconsistent
- the sign up header and the footer nav bar have increase letter spacing
- no other text has this
- keep consistent across UI

#### 4. Header Text Inconsistent
- all words but 1 are capitalized in main text header
- capitalize all words in text header

#### 5. Menu Icon
- on desktop we currently see all the navigation links
- is having the menu icon necessary?
  - if there are more links yes
  - in there are no more links no
- possibly remove menu icon for desktop and reintroduce for mobile views
