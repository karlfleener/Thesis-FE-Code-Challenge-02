## Suggested Updates to UI

### 1. Text Styling Consistency
- header navigation is capitalized
- footer navigation is all uppercase
- keep the styling for both navigation consistent

### 2. Font Consistency
- Multiple fonts are used across the UI
- If we want to have multiple fonts we could do the following...
  - all headers should be 1 consistent font
  - all paragraph bodies should be 1 consistent font
- Else keep font consistent across UI

### 3. Letter Spacing Inconsistent
- the sign up header and the footer nav bar have increase letter spacing
- no other text has this
- keep consistent across UI

### 4. Header Text Inconsistent
- all words but 1 are capitalized in main text header
- capitalize all words in text header
